        <Abstract>
            <AbstractText Label="DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS">Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is characterized by cutaneous photosensitivity (usually beginning in infancy or childhood) that results in tingling, burning, pain, and itching within minutes of sun/light exposure and may be accompanied by swelling and redness. Vesicular lesions are uncommon. Symptoms, which may seem out of proportion to the visible skin lesions, may persist for hours or days after the initial phototoxic reaction. Photosensitivity usually remains for life. Multiple episodes of acute photosensitivity may lead to chronic changes of sun-exposed skin (lichenification, leathery pseudovesicles, grooving around the lips) and loss of lunulae of the nails. Approximately 20%-30% of individuals with EPP have some degree of liver dysfunction, which is typically mild with slight elevations of the liver enzymes. Up to 5% may develop more advanced liver disease which may be accompanied by motor neuropathy, similar to that seen in the acute porphyrias. Except for the small minority with advanced liver disease, life expectancy is not reduced.</AbstractText>
            <AbstractText Label="DIAGNOSIS/TESTING">Detection of markedly increased free erythrocyte protoporphyrin is the most sensitive and specific biochemical diagnostic test for EPP. Identification of biallelic mutations in FECH, encoding ferrochelatase, confirms the diagnosis.</AbstractText>
            <AbstractText Label="MANAGEMENT">Treatment of manifestations: There is no FDA-approved treatment for this disease or specific treatment for the acute photosensitivity. The pain is not responsive to narcotic analgesics. The only effective current treatment is prevention of the painful attacks by avoidance of sun/light (including the long-wave ultraviolet light sunlight that passes through window glass) through use of protective clothing (e.g., long sleeves, gloves, wide-brimmed hats, protective tinted glass for cars and windows). Although topical sunscreens are typically not useful, some tanning products containing creams which cause increased pigmentation may be helpful. Oral Lumitene™ (β-carotene) may improve tolerance to sunlight by causing mild skin discoloration due to carotenemia. Severe liver complications are difficult to treat: cholestyramine and other porphyrin absorbents (to interrupt the enterohepatic circulation of protoporphyrin and promote its fecal excretion) and plasmapheresis and intravenous hemin are sometimes beneficial. Liver transplantation may be required. Prevention of secondary complications: Vitamin D supplementation to prevent vitamin D insufficiency due to sun avoidance. Surveillance: Monitoring of: hepatic function every 6-12 months and hepatic imaging if cholelithiasis is suspected; erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels (free and zinc-chelated), hematologic indices, and iron profile annually; vitamin D 25-OH levels. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sunlight and UV light; for those with hepatic dysfunction, drugs that may induce cholestasis (e.g., estrogens); for those with cholestatic liver failure, use of protective filters for artificial lights in the operating room to avoid phototoxic damage Evaluation of relatives at risk: If both FECH mutations have been identified in an affected family member, at-risk relatives with biallelic mutations can be tested as newborns or infants to allow early intervention (sun protection) and future monitoring for signs of liver dysfunction. Therapies under investigation: Clinical trials are underway for afamelanotide, α-melanocyte stimulating hormone analogue, which increases skin pigmentation by increasing melanin production.</AbstractText>
            <AbstractText Label="GENETIC COUNSELING">EPP is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In 90%-95% of cases an affected individual inherits a loss-of-function FECH allele from one parent and a low-expression FECH allele from the other parent. In about 5%-10% of cases, an affected individual has two loss-of-function FECH alleles. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Heterozygotes (carriers) and individuals who inherit two low-expression alleles are asymptomatic. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the disease-causing mutations in the family have been identified.</AbstractText>
